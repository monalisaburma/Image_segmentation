# AI Pipeline for Image Segmentation and Object Analysis

## Overview
This project is designed to develop a comprehensive AI pipeline that performs advanced image analysis. The pipeline processes input images by segmenting objects, identifying them, extracting relevant data, and generating a detailed summary. The final output integrates these insights into a visually annotated image and a structured summary table, providing a powerful tool for understanding and interpreting complex image content.

## Requirements
To run this project, you'll need to install the required Python libraries. You can install them using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Files Included
Untitled52.ipynb: The main Jupyter notebook containing the code for image segmentation, object extraction, identification, and analysis.
requirements.txt: A file containing the list of Python libraries required to run the notebook.
